# Ex3_OOp

### This README explains the 3rd assignment we got on OOP course in Ariel university.
### In this project we were asked to implement a Python weighted directed graph.

#### The assignment has three parts:
#### The first and the second part is to create a directed weighted graph in python 
there were 3 classes for this part:

•	nodeData represents the nodes in the graph, each node has some information and a geoLocation object.

•	DiGraph represents the graph itself, includes nodes, edges and mode account that count the changes in the graph.

•	GraphAlgo is the class that made to use any given graph, the functions in this class are shortest way between two nodes, connected components and component, save, load, get graph and plot. 

#### The third part is to compare our graph vs NetworkX vs Java:
In this part we compared the different programs. We wrote tests to check each one of them. The function we were compared are shortest path, connected components and connected component (NetworkX does not have connected component).
